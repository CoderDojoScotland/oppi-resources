		<div class="col-md-8">
			<p><a href="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is a visual programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is used throughout the world in education as an introduction to programming - rather than worrying about typing skills and code syntax, Scratch allows programs to be build by connecting "blocks" of code.</p>

			<p>The Kinect2Scratch library allows data from a Microsoft Kinect controller be sent to Scratch.
This means that anyone can write programs with motion control, use gestures, make kinetic games and generally leap about having fun. This is an extension of Scratch that as well as being inspirational allows learners to explore non-traditional user input (rather than keyboard and mouse).</p>

			<p>An example activity is creating a 2 player space-invader style game called "Alien Attack". To control the spacecraft you must move left and right, to fire you must throw both hands up above your head.</p>

			<p>The <a href="http://scratch.saorog.com/">Kinnet2Scratch library</a> was developed by <a href="http://saorog.com/">Stephen Howell</a>, a CoderDojo mentor.</p>

  <div class="panel-heading"><h4>Google Blockly</h4></div>
  <div class="panel-body">

  	<div class="col-md-8">
  	<p>
  	<a href="https://code.google.com/p/blockly/">Blockly</a> is a visual programming language developed by Google. Users drag and drop blocks of code together to make their own programs. <br/><br/>

  	At our Dojo's we often use the Maze exercise as an introduction to digital making. This exercise is a great tool for introducing programming concepts, covering the use of IF statements and loops. <br/><br/>

  	The young people enjoy the fact it is like a puzzle or game, and that they progress through the levels. While the early levels start off pretty straight forward, as it progresses they become more difficult. Level 10 is difficult for any programmer. <br/><br/>

  	We normally suggest they work together and 'pair programming' - explaining their tactics and algorithms to each other. This is a great tool for developing computational thinking skills.<br/><br/>

	<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Mozilla Webmaker and Meme Showcase</h4></div>
	<div class="panel-body">

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<p><a href="https://webmaker.org/">Webmaker</a> is a web based text editor build by the Mozilla team. Using Webmaker, HTML code is presented on the left hand side and the resulting web page is displayed on the right. Learners can edit the code and see the page automatically updated with those changes.</p>

			<p>This a really useful tool in our Dojos. It is web based so doesn't need any extra software to installed. Also, the learners appreciate being able to see the results of their changes instantly. It gives them a sense of achievement - they can rapidly create a page to show to friends.</p>

			<p>One of the most popular Webmaker templates is the <a href="https://openmatt.makes.org/thimble/meme-maker/remix">Meme Maker</a>. Learners can remix the code to build their own Meme. We have created a tool to <a href="http://coderdojo.co/stirling/">showcase</a> the Memes created by the young people. You can <a href="https://github.com/CoderDojoScotland/Meme-Showcase">download this tool</a> from our GitHub.</p>

		<div class="col-md-8">

		<p><a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> is another tool that allows learners to write code in the browser. Like WebMaker, the benefits are quick and visual results.</p>
		<p>As well as HTML, CodePen also allows the learner to add CSS and JavaScript code. It's even possible to quickly link in common libraries and framworks such as JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
		<p>CodePen encourages forking other peoples code. Learners can experiment and play around with code created by other developers.</p>

<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Security &amp; Cryptography</h4></div>
<div class="panel-body">

	<div class="col-md-8">

	<p>Last summer we ran two Cryptography Dojos at Glasgow Science Centre based on the idea of sending and decoding secret messages. The young coders learned about ciphers, from the Caesar cipher used by Roman Emperor Julius Caesar 2000 years ago, to RSA encryption  used to provide secure internet connections for online shopping today.  They also learned about methods used to break these ciphers.
	<p>After breaking a few messages encrypted using  a Caesar cipher "by hand", the coders were given a Python program that implemented the same cipher, but had several bits missing.  During the remainder of the session they implemented the decrypt function, a function that allowed the user to specify the encryption key used, and a brute force function to enable any message to be broken quickly.</p>

	<p>This code was also used during some workshops with CBBC at their "Live in Leeds" event last summer, and as part of a "Cryptography Treasure Hunt" with a group of coders from the Princes' Trust where the "treasure" was the means to save Glasgow from an attack by the Extreme Violence and Insurrection League (E.V.I.L.).</p>

	<p>Mixing digital making with story telling was a great way to engage young people who had perhaps no previous interest in digital technologies. Those attending the CBBC workshop had attended because they liked the characters and the CBBC brand, and for many this was their first experience of computing coding.</p>

	<p>Read more about it on <a href="http://coderdojoscotland.com/blog/310/cryptography-resources">our blog</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/CoderDojoScotland/Crypto-Dojo">download the code</a> from our GitHub</p>

  <div class="panel-heading"><h4>Server Thingy</h4></div>
  <div class="panel-body">

  <div class="row">
  	<div class="col-md-8">
  	<p>This is a simple tool for running a static web server on any machine. We use this in our Dojos often because it is easy to use and can be setup on any machine in a few seconds. Using this tool, the learner's machines will behave like a web server, allowing them to build and test their websites and web apps.</p>

  	<p>Server Thingy was built by young developer, and CoderDojo mentor, <a href="http://j.dytry.ch/">Joe Dytrych</a>.</p>

<p>The badges issued by the Open Badges project are digital indicators of skills learned inside or outside the classroom. Last year, CoderDojo Scotland joined other companies like NASA and Disney-Pixar, and became an Open Badge issuer.</p>
